# Room of Requirement
Formerly known as RoomofRequirement.gq and RoomofRequirement.tk 😢

This is a static website that I use when I need to host a webpage for any occasion. It does not have a unified purpose and likely has unfinished or never used projects. It primarily serves as an easy way to publish a webpage.

Found at: [https://be-code.github.io/RoomofRequirement.github.io/](https://be-code.github.io/RoomofRequirement.github.io/)

## Name Change
Previously this site had its own domain, but seemingly due to expenses of various lawsuits, .tk and freenom projects have shut down.
